## 3. Setup Instructions
### Docker
**Requirements**
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Steps
1. Clone repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:rishiqwerty/event-management-backend.git
cd event-management-backend/eventmanagement/
```
2. Build and run containers:
docker compose up --build

3. Run Migrations
docker compose run web python manage.py migrate

4. Create Superuser For admin panel:
docker compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser

5. Running Tests
To run test make sure we are in project folder, where manage.py file is present
```
pytest
```
Note:
Concurrency Test for reservation will only pass when we are using postgresql

### Local Development
**Requirements**
- Python3.13
- direnv

**Steps**
1. Clone repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:rishiqwerty/event-management-backend.git
cd event-management-backend/eventmanagement/
```
2. Build environment using direnv:
```
direnv allow
```
3. Now install poetry.
```
pip install poetry
```
4. Install all the porject required packages:
```
poetry install
```

5. Run Migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create Superuser For admin panel:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. Running Tests
To run test make sure we are in project folder, where manage.py file is present
```
pytest
```
Note:
Concurrency Test for reservation will only pass when we are using postgresql


## 4. Design Choices
**i. Data Modelling**
- **User**:
  Based on Djangoâ€™s built-in `User` model.
  - A user can act as an **organizer** (create/manage events) or as an **attendee** (reserve events).
  - The relationship enables filtering events by organizer and associating reservations to the loggedin user.

- **Event**:
  Stores event details.
  - Linked to an **organizer (User)**.
  - `capacity` defines the maximum allowed participants.
  - `seats_remaining` is updated atomically during bookings/cancellations.

- **Reservation**:
  Explicit join model between **User** and **Event**.
  - Stores who reserved which event.
  - Enforces uniqueness via `unique_together (user, event)` to prevent duplicate bookings.
  - Handles business logic like decrementing available seats when created and restoring them when canceled.

**ii. Concurrency Handling**
- **Atomic Transactions**:
  Reservation creation is wrapped in a `transaction.atomic()` block. This ensures that seat decrement and reservation creation happen as a single unit.

- **Optimistic Locking via Database Constraint**:
  Seat availability is updated at the database level:
  ```
  Event.objects.filter(
      pk=event.pk,
      seats_remaining__gt=0
  ).update(seats_remaining=F('seats_remaining') - 1)
  ```

Swagger docs will be available at:

```
While Authorizing in Docs make sure to provide 'Token <value>' as token for authentication
